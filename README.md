Ya-ho! Citadel Scribe is born. 

I am a budding web developer who's passionate about education, health/fitness and traveling. I love reading, writing, drawing, cooking, hiking and gaming. The need to create, or experience new things is what drives me. Welcome to the beginning of my journey in Web Development.
